# Getting started #

## On Linux ##

For Linux users, just download the binaries for your architecture and read the UserGuide.

## On Windows ##

FullAnalyze can be built on Windows but this is not recommended and some features won't work fine.
If you don't have a Linux installation, an alternative would be to run a virtual machine. You can download [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and install Ubuntu.
